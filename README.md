A distributed smart feeding system for pets, built using microservice architecture and asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ.

---

## üìå --- Overview ---üìå

`SmartPetFeeder` simulates a real-world system where a sensor detects a pet near a feeder and publishes an event. Another service listens for this event and triggers the release of food.

This project demonstrates:
- Microservices with Spring Boot
- Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Practical application of event-driven design
